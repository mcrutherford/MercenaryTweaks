# Overview

Adds a variety of toggleable Mercenary tweaks

M1 Attack Speed Fix, enabled by default, makes merc's 3rd m1 unaffected by attack speed, allowing you to take attack speed items without worrying about your m1 extension timing, breaks at 18.0 attack speed for some reason

M2 Attack Speed Ignore, enabled by default, makes Whirlwind and Rising Thunder completely unaffected by attack speed, keeping their movement utility and combo timing consistent throughout the run

Full Jump Reset, disabled by default, resets ALL of your jumps on kill, including your ground jump, pretty fun, but very cursed looking

Extra Jump On Kill, enabled by default, gives you a jump back when killing an enemy

Single Target Eviscerate, enabled by default, makes eviscerate target a single enemy at a time, and targets the lowest health enemy, great synergy with Massacre and Slayer

Eviscerate Massacre Upgrade, enabled by default, adds the Massacre upgrade from StandaloneAncientScepter, but with the 2x duration removed, resets Eviscerate's duration on kill, allowing you to chain-kill groups of enemies

Eviscerate Slayer Upgrade, enabled by default, gives Eviscerate the "slayer" tag, making it deal more damage to lower health enemies

Eviscerate Damage Coefficient, 1.1 by default, allows you to change how much damage each hit deals to suit your preference
